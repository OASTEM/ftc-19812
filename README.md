# Today's Assignment
Fix up your LinearSlide files and implement the encoders in order to set limits on how far the slide can go up and down (Top: -3115.0, Bottom: -20.0)
So that if it's extending and it hits the limit, it goes onto the **next state** (up > hold, or down > hold).
And during the **hold** state, exert a ***tiny*** upwards force constantly to counteract gravity (just trial and error).
***PULL REQUEST BY 4:40PM!!!***
